1:05
* Meeting start
* Demonstrating the app to the client
* The selected label should be visualised in some way
* The labels may be too inaccessible on smaller screens if there are lots of labels (if the user is recording accelerometer data this scrolling to find a new label may interfere with data)

1:13
* We are taking the client about the marks
* The client would like to see everyone participate in client meetings
* The clients would like to understand why we made decisions (?)
* The clients feel like we could have researched more on the sensors


The client is very happy with the work that has been produced so far

1:20
* meeting finished
