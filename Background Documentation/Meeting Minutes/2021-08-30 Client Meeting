* hanna likes the idea of us walking through a full decision making process. We should signpost that we are providing an example

4:37
* should we make a different document to outline the process of our tools? - hanna believes that they are fine where they are but that we should document how we got to the decision that we made

4:39
* how can we show the value gained from the tech launcher process?  - hanna says that we need to brainstorm as a team what the value is. examples may be that we have figured out where our career may go or our the software development process works. 
* possibly that we have learned more about professional ethics

* We cannot use this logo however because it has not been improved
* we should make sure that the logo looks more like a picture or highly stylised text
