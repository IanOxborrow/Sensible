* meeting start
* the clients have not tested the android app yet

* their ultimate goal is to have both OSs supporting the app
* we can use part of the techlanucher budget to pay for developer accounts

11:10
* because we are using human to test our product we need to have ethics approval
* the applications should take a maximum of four weeks to be approved
* Two different ethics application should be put in so that we can test on disabled people and non-disabled people

11:25
* discussion about the preferred sensors from chirath and robin
* the magnetometer is very valuable because it matches existing sensors
* gps is also a high priority sensor

11:26
* Ryan has left

11:30
* hanna has arrived
* previous apps that measure people will measure different people because of how the device is carried

* hannas biggest concerns in the app at the moment is the labelling is simplistic at the moment. 


I think hanna is saying that the effectiveness of the app in terms of the labelling is a part of the user experience and that is what we are testing?
